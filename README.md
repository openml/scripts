## generate_semantic_tag/generate_semantic_tag.ipynb

This script generates semantic tag(s) for each dataset present in OpenML.org.
For each dataset, the data description, along with a predefined list of tags is used to prompt GPT-3.5-turbo, which in turn assigns semantic tag(s) from the given list of tags.
